# These settings are specific to hardening the kernel itself from attack
# from userspace, rather than protecting userspace from other malicious
# userspace things.
#
#
# When an attacker is trying to exploit the local kernel, it is often
# helpful to be able to examine where in memory the kernel, modules,
# and data structures live. As such, kernel addresses should be treated
# as sensitive information.
#
# Many files and interfaces contain these addresses (e.g. /proc/kallsyms,
# /proc/modules, etc), and this setting can censor the addresses. A value
# of "0" allows all users to see the kernel addresses. A value of "1"
# limits visibility to the root user, and "2" blocks even the root user.
