# SSI_Materials

In the course *Seguridad de Sistemas Informáticos* (SSI, Computer Systems Security) from the *Escuela de Ingeniería Informática* of the University of Oviedo (https://ingenieriainformatica.uniovi.es/) we have developed a series of automated infrastructure deployment scripts that we think it may be useful for some people, so we decided to share them to enable our students (or anyone ;)) to use and experiment with them if they please. We will be updating this repo over time with new materials we can share. 

Please check this repo *Wiki* (https://github.com/jose-r-lopez/SSI_Materials/wiki/1.-Home) to know more details about all these materials! I hope you enjoy experimenting with them and find them useful! (if you feel like it, let me know with an star on this repo :D)

**NOTE**: Make sure you check my tool cheatsheet repository to facilitate learning how to use these tools inside this laboratories! (https://github.com/jose-r-lopez/SSI_Cheatsheets).
 
 **NEW 2.0 VERSION AVAILABLE!!**. Features:
 
 - More *Vagrant* machines (see wiki)
 - Multiple bug fixes
 - New (and proper!) way of using *Vagrant*, that decreases the number of possible incidents, greatly decreases build times, and ensures better VM deployment.
 - Refactoring of *Vagrant* provisioners to greatly increase modularity, maintainability, and facilitate building new machines combining calls to existing scripts. Code once, reuse everywhere!
 - New automatically hardened Ubuntu increasing its Lynis hardening score **from 89 to 94 points!**. Don't miss this machine to learn more about OS hardening!
