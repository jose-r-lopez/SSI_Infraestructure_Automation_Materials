# Infraestructure Automation Materials

In the course *Seguridad de Sistemas Informáticos* (SSI, Computer Systems Security) from the *Escuela de Ingeniería Informática* of the University of Oviedo (https://ingenieriainformatica.uniovi.es/) and also on my *Master on Web Engineering* courses we have developed a series of automated infrastructure deployment scripts that we think it may be useful for some people, so we decided to share them to enable our students (or anyone ;)) to use and experiment with them if they please. We will be updating this repo over time with new materials we can share. 

Please **check this repo Wiki (https://github.com/jose-r-lopez/SSI_Materials/wiki/1.-Home)** to know more details about all these materials! I hope you enjoy experimenting with them and find them useful! (if you feel like it, let me know with an star on this repo :D)

**NOTE**: Make sure you check my **security materials repository** to facilitate learning how to use security tools inside these laboratories! **(https://github.com/jose-r-lopez/SSI_Extra_Materials)**.
 
 **NEW 2.0 VERSION AVAILABLE!!**. Features:
 
 - More *Vagrant* machines (see wiki)
 - Multiple bug fixes. Provisioners will not run multiple times any longer.
 - New (and proper!) way of using *Vagrant*, that decreases the number of possible incidents, greatly decreases build times, and ensures better VM deployment.
 - Refactoring of *Vagrant* provisioners to greatly increase modularity, maintainability, and facilitate building new machines combining calls to existing scripts. Code once, reuse everywhere!
 - New automatically hardened Ubuntu increasing its Lynis hardening score **from 89 to 94 points!**. Don't miss this machine to learn more about OS hardening!
 - Linux (bash) and Windows (bat) scripts included together for improved usability.
 - New and improved documentation

Like? Stars are appreciated :)
Use? If you let me know I will be happy!
Have VMWare Desktop or libvirt and you can help me to polish my scripts with these hypervisors? As I don't have them right now, any help will be appreciated!
